Assume A is lying. Then A's statement \"It was Bingyu\" is false, meaning the criminal is not Bingyu. But since the criminal is among A, B, C, and D, and only one is lying, the other three are telling the truth. So, B, C, D are truthful. Then, B says \"I didn't steal,\" so B is telling the truth. C says \"I didn't steal,\" so C is truthful. D says \"If B didn't steal, then I stole.\" Since B is truthful, the antecedent is true. So, D's statement is a conditional. For D to be truthful, the implication must hold. The implication is \"If B didn't steal, then D stole.\" Since B didn't steal, D must have stolen. But D is one of the suspects, so D could be the criminal. However, if D is the criminal, then D is lying because the criminal is among A, B, C, D. Wait, but we assumed A is lying, so only A is lying. So, if D is the criminal, then D is lying, which would make two liars (A and D), which contradicts the condition that only one is lying. Therefore, A cannot be lying because that would require D to be lying as well, which is not allowed. So, A cannot be lying.\n\n2. Assume B is lying. Then B's statement \"I didn't steal\" is false, meaning B did steal. But if B is lying, then B is the criminal. Let's see if this holds. If B is the criminal, then A is truthful (\"It was Bingyu\"), B is lying (\"I didn't steal\"), C is truthful (\"",

The options are numbered 0 to 3, and I need to pick the correct one or multiple if applicable.\n\nFirst, let me break down the information. Teacher Wang is criticizing Xiao Li for being late in math class. So, the immediate reaction is that Xiao Li is late. But the question is, if that conclusion is true, which of the options must also be true.\n\nLet me look at each option one by one.\n\nOption 0: Xiao Li was late for class.\n\nWell, the teacher criticized Xiao Li for being late, so that directly implies that Xiao Li was late. So, if the conclusion is that Xiao Li was late, then Option 0 is correct.\n\nOption 1: Someone in the school did not observe classroom discipline.\n\nHmm, the teacher criticized Xiao Li for being late. That could be because of discipline, but it doesn't necessarily mean that someone didn't observe the discipline. It's possible that the teacher noticed Xiao Li was late and took action against him, but it's also possible that the school didn't observe the discipline because the teacher didn't check. So, this is a bit of a leap. The fact that Xiao Li was late could be due to discipline, but it doesn't have to be because the school didn't observe it. So, I don't think Option 1 is necessarily true.\n\nOption 2: Xiao Li doesn't like math class.\n\nThe teacher criticized Xiao Li for being late, but that doesn't necessarily mean Xiao Li dislikes math. It could be that the teacher noticed Xiao Li was late because he was disruptive or didn't pay attention, but it's possible that Xiao Li actually likes math class. So, this isn't necessarily true either.\n\nOption 3: The time of the math class is clear.\n\nAgain, the teacher criticized Xiao Li for being late, but that doesn't necessarily mean the math class time was clear. It could have been unclear, and Xiao Li was just late because of that. So, this isn't necessarily true.\n\nSo, going back, only Option 0 is definitely true if the conclusion is that Xiao Li was late.

That means the teacher believes Xiao Li is not following the rules or discipline in the math class.\n\nNow, the question is, if the teacher's conclusion is true, what can we infer about Xiao Li?\n\nLet's break down the teacher's statement: \"How come you are late for the math class?\".\n\nThis statement is a question about Xiao Li's lateness. The teacher is pointing out that Xiao Li is late, which suggests that Xiao Li is not adhering to the discipline or rules in the math class.\n\nSo, the teacher's criticism implies that Xiao Li is not following the discipline. Therefore, the school likely has a policy that requires students to be on time, and Xiao Li's lateness is a violation of that policy.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nOption 0: Xiao Li was late for class.\n\nThis is a direct statement that Xiao Li was late. However, the teacher's criticism is about Xiao Li being late, not necessarily that he was late. The teacher could have criticized him for being late, but it's possible that Xiao Li was on time, and the teacher just noticed that he was late. So, Option 0 is a possible conclusion, but it's not necessarily the only conclusion.\n\nOption 1: Someone in the school did not observe classroom discipline.\n\nThis is a broader statement. The teacher's criticism could be pointing out that someone didn't observe discipline, but it's also possible that Xiao Li was late for another reason, not necessarily because of discipline. So, Option 1 is a possible conclusion, but it's not necessarily the only conclusion.\n\nOption 2: Xiao Li doesn't like math class.\n\nThis is a statement about Xiao Li's dislike for math class. The teacher's criticism is about being late, not about Xiao Li's dislike. So, Option 2 is not necessarily true.\n\nOption 3: The time of the math class is clear.\n\nThis is a statement about the clarity of the math class time. The teacher's criticism is about being late, not about the time of the class.

The coach is asking Xiao Dai why he's late again. So, the coach is trying to figure out why Xiao Dai is not performing well in the training class.\n\nNow, the question is about the default behavior of coaches when they ask such questions. The options are about Xiao Dai's reasons for being late.\n\nOption 0 suggests that Xiao Dai doesn't like football training classes. That could be a possible reason, but it's not the default. Coaches might ask this if they suspect Xiao Dai is uninterested or not motivated.\n\nOption 1 suggests that Xiao Dai is intentionally late. This is a possible reason, but again, it's not the default. Coaches might ask this if they suspect Xiao Dai is trying to cheat or is not following the training schedule.\n\nOption 2 suggests that no other students are late for this football training class. This is a possible default behavior. If the coach is asking why Xiao Dai is late, and if they don't have any other students who are late, they might assume that Xiao Dai is the only one who is late, or that the coach is asking to check if Xiao Dai is the only one.\n\nOption 3 suggests that Xiao Dai was late for football training classes in the past. This is another possible reason, but it's not the default. Coaches might ask this if they suspect Xiao Dai has been late before, perhaps due to a pattern or a misunderstanding.\n\nSo, the default behavior would be when the coach asks why Xiao Dai is late, and if there are no other students who are late, they might assume that Xiao Dai is the only one. Therefore, the default is likely Option 2.\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe in some cases, coaches might ask this if they suspect Xiao Dai is not performing well, but that's not the default. The default is when the coach is trying to figure out the reason for Xiao Dai's lateness, and if they don't have any other students who are late, they might assume that Xiao Dai is the only one.\n\nAlternatively, if the coach is asking why Xiao Dai is late, and they don't have any other students who are late, they might assume",

The software is limited to those who sign in to enter the computer. It can't just analyze the shape of the signature; it also looks at pen pressure, speed, and the person's signature. Even the smartest people can't copy all the features the program can analyze.\n\nNow, the question is asking which of the given options can be logically derived from this context.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nOption 0: The time it takes to record and analyze a signature makes the daily use of such software unrealistic.\n\nHmm, the context says that the software is limited to those who sign in to enter the computer. It can't just analyze the signature; it needs more features. So, if someone wants to use the software daily, they might need to analyze more features, which takes time. So, maybe the daily use becomes unrealistic because it's time-consuming. So, Option 0 might be correct.\n\nOption 1: Computers that install this software will soon be equipped by most banks.\n\nThe context doesn't mention anything about banks or their reliance on this software. It just talks about the software's limitations. So, I don't think this can be concluded. Option 1 is probably incorrect.\n\nOption 2: No one can enter the computer where this software is installed just by forging signatures.\n\nThe context says the software is limited to those who sign in to enter. So, if someone wants to enter the computer, they need to sign in. Forging a signature would mean creating a fake one, but the software requires actual signatures. So, maybe someone can't enter the computer just by forging signatures. But the context doesn't specify whether forging is allowed or not. It just says the software is limited to signing in. So, perhaps Option 2 is correct.\n\nOption 3: The signature recognition software has spent many years developing and improving.\n\nThe context doesn't provide any information about the software's age. It just mentions that it's been installed and used. So, I don't think we can conclude that it's been around for many years. Option",

Earlier models are still in production. In the first year, both models were sold at the same time, and the earlier models sold more. The manufacturer concluded that safety wasn't the customer's primary concern. We need to find which option would most severely weaken this conclusion.\n\nFirst, let's understand the manufacturer's conclusion. They think that safety is not the main factor why the earlier models sold better. So, the reasoning is that safety wasn't a big issue, so the earlier models sold more despite being less safe.\n\nTo weaken this conclusion, we need to find a reason that explains why the earlier models sold more despite being less safe. That is, we need to find a factor that is more important to the customers than safety.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption 0: Both private aircraft owners and commercial airlines purchase engines from this manufacturer. So, if more people are buying from this manufacturer, perhaps they have more control over the safety features. If the manufacturer is a major player, maybe they can offer better safety features, or perhaps they have more control over the engines. Alternatively, if more people are buying from this manufacturer, maybe they have more influence on the safety of the engines. So, if this manufacturer is a major player, perhaps they can offer better safety, but if they're not, maybe they can't. Wait, but the manufacturer's new engine is lacking safety, so perhaps they can't offer better safety. But if more people are buying from them, maybe they can offer better safety. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.\n\nOption 1: Many customers believe that the earlier models are smaller in terms of security risks. So, if customers think the earlier models are safer, they might buy more. But in this case, the earlier models sold more, so the manufacturer's conclusion is that safety isn't a primary concern. So, if customers think the earlier models are safer, they would buy more, which would contradict the manufacturer's conclusion. So, this would weaken the conclusion.\n\nOption 2: Many customers purchase engines from other manufacturers. These other manufacturers don't provide additional safety features.

It also emphasizes that agriculture is the foundation of China's economy and that the growth rate of agriculture must be maintained above 4.3%.\n\nTo support this argument, we need an option that aligns with the idea that agriculture is crucial for China's economy and that its growth rate must be maintained despite a declining share.\n\n**Option 0: China has always been a country dominated by agriculture.**  \nThis option supports the argument by stating that China has always been a country dominated by agriculture, which is a key point in the argument.\n\n**Option 1: China is a country with a billion people.**  \nThis option is irrelevant to the argument.\n\n**Option 2: China has been the most industrialized in the past decade.**  \nThis option is irrelevant to the argument.\n\n**Option 3: China's national conditions require agriculture to maintain growth despite the decline in its share.**  \nThis option supports the argument by stating that China's national conditions require maintaining agricultural growth despite a declining share.\n\nBoth **Option 0** and **Option 3** support the argument.

It also mentions that China is a dominant agriculture country.\n\nStep 2: Analyze each option to see if it supports the argument.\nOption 0: If China has always been a country dominated by agriculture, that would mean agriculture has been a significant part of their economy. However, the argument is about the share declining, so this might not directly support it. It could be a possible point, but it's not the strongest.\n\nOption 1: China has a billion people. While population size is relevant, the argument doesn't mention anything about population growth or its size. It's more about the share of agriculture in GDP, so this might not directly support the argument.\n\nOption 2: China has been the most industrialized in the past decade. Industrialization is a measure of economic development, but the argument is about the share of agriculture in GDP, not industrial output. So this might not directly support the argument.\n\nOption 3: China's national conditions require agriculture to maintain growth despite the decline in its share. This seems to directly address the need for maintaining a growth rate above 4.3%. It's a possible correct option.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate each option's relevance to the argument.\nOption 3 seems to directly address the need for maintaining a growth rate despite the decline in agriculture's share. It's a possible correct option.\n\nOption 0: While it's true that China has been a dominant agriculture country, it doesn't directly address the decline in agriculture's share or the need to maintain a growth rate. It's more of a fact than a support for the argument.\n\nOption 1 and 2: They don't directly relate to the argument's points about the share decline and the required growth rate.

The original statement is about M La, not about Egyptian archaeologists. So, if someone is an Egyptian archaeologist and has visited more than 10 Egyptian pyramids, does that mean they must be Egyptian? Wait, no, that's not necessarily the case. The original statement is about M La, not about all Egyptian archaeologists. So, this option is talking about Egyptian archaeologists, but the original statement doesn't say anything about them.

So, is R (Xiao Na failed the exam) necessarily true?\n\nWait, the original proposition is (P \u2227 \u00acQ) \u2192 \u00acR. So, if (P \u2227 \u00acQ) is true, then \u00acR must be true. But if (P \u2227 \u00acQ) is false, then the implication is automatically true, regardless of R.\n\nSo, the contrapositive is R \u2192 \u00ac(P \u2227 \u00acQ), which is equivalent to R \u2192 \u00acP \u2228 Q.\n\nBut does this mean that if R is true, then \u00ac(P \u2227 \u00acQ) must be true? Yes, because R \u2192 (\u00acP \u2228 Q) is equivalent to \u00acR \u2228 (\u00acP \u2228 Q), which is the same as (\u00acP \u2228 Q \u2228 \u00acR).\n\nBut the question is whether we can conclude that Daejeon passed the exam, i.e., Q is true.\n\nWait, the original proposition is (P \u2227 \u00acQ) \u2192 \u00acR. So, if (P \u2227 \u00acQ) is true, then \u00acR is true. But if (P \u2227 \u00acQ) is false, then the implication is true regardless of R.\n\nSo, the contrapos",

Let me rephrase it. The original proposition is about the relationship between P, Q, and R. The question is asking whether, given that proposition is true, we can conclude that Q is true, i.e., Daejeon passed the exam.\n\nBut the options suggest that the conclusion is that Daejeon passed the exam, which would be Q being true. So, the question is whether, given (P \u2227 \u00acQ) \u2192 \u00acR is true, can we conclude Q?\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because if (P \u2227 \u00acQ) \u2192 \u00acR is true, then whenever P is true and Q is false, R must be false.

So, the expert is saying that there's a possibility that house prices will go up, but it's not guaranteed.\n\nNow, let's look at the options. Option 0 says, \"House prices cannot fail to rise.\" This seems to be the opposite of the expert's statement. If the expert said there's a possibility of rising house prices, then saying they cannot fail to rise would mean that house prices will definitely rise. That seems too strong.\n\nOption 1 is, \"House prices do not necessarily increase.\" This is a bit different from the expert's statement. The expert said there's a possibility of rising house prices, but it's not certain. So, \"do not necessarily increase\" would mean that house prices might stay the same or decrease, which is not exactly what the expert said. The expert was saying that there's a chance they will rise, but not that they will definitely.\n\nOption 2 is the same as Option 1. It also says, \"House prices do not necessarily increase.\" So, this is redundant, but it's still the same meaning as Option 1.\n\nOption 3 is, \"The possibility of rising house prices is very small.\" This is the opposite of what the expert said. The expert was predicting that there's a possibility of rising house prices, so this option is saying the opposite, which is not correct.\n\nSo, after analyzing all the options, the correct one is Option 1 or Option 2, both of which convey the same meaning as the expert's statement. However, since the options are presented as separate choices, and Option 1 is the first one, I think the answer is Option 1.\n\nWait, but the options are labeled 0, 1, 2, 3.

Option 1 is \"House prices do not necessarily increase.\" So, the expert said that there's a possibility of rising, but not that they will not increase. So, Option 1 is the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, the expert said \"may rise,\" which is a probabilistic statement.

So, the given context is that all metals are conductive, and iron is conductive, so iron is a metal. Now, I need to find which of the options follows a similar reasoning structure.\n\nFirst, let's break down the given reasoning. It starts with two premises: all metals are conductive, and iron is a metal. Then, it concludes that iron is conductive. So, the structure is: All M are C, and S is M, therefore S is C.\n\nLooking at the options, each one has a similar structure but with different subjects and predicates.

The second premise is that copper is a metal, which is a specific instance. Then, the conclusion is that copper is conductive. So, this follows the same structure as the given reasoning. So, Option 0 might be the correct answer.\n\nOption 1: Associate professors are intellectuals, and researchers are not associate professors, so researchers are not intellectuals.\n\nHmm, this seems to be a syllogism as well. The first premise is that associate professors are intellectuals. The second premise is that researchers are not associate professors. The conclusion is that researchers are not intellectuals. So, this is a valid syllogism. But does it follow the same structure as the given reasoning?\n\nWait, the given reasoning is about metals and iron, which are specific instances. Option 1 is about associate professors and researchers, which are categories. So, the structure is different. The given reasoning is about all metals being conductive, and a specific metal being a metal, leading to a specific conclusion. Option 1 is about all professors being intellectuals, and a specific category (researchers) not being a professor, leading to a conclusion about researchers. So, the structure is similar but the subjects are different. So, Option 1 is a different structure.\n\nOption 2: All birds are not plants. Sparrows are birds, so sparrows are not plants.\n\nThis is another syllogism. The first premise is that all birds are not plants. The second premise is that sparrows are birds.

The results show that when there are more potassium fertilizers than phosphate, variety 1 grows better than variety 2, and vice versa. This suggests that both potassium and phosphate fertilizers are important for rice growth, and their relative amounts may influence which variety grows better.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\n- **Option 0**: This claims that varieties 1 and 2 do not require other fertilizers. However, the experiments specifically mention potassium and phosphate fertilizers, indicating that other fertilizers may be necessary. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n- **Option 1**: This states that nitrogen fertilizer is needed for rice growth. The experiments focus on potassium and phosphate, not nitrogen. There is no evidence suggesting that nitrogen is required. Thus, this option is incorrect.\n\n- **Option 2**: This suggests that variety 1 and variety 2 have different requirements for fertilizers. The experiments show that the relative amounts of potassium and phosphate affect which variety grows better, implying that their requirements are different. Therefore, this option is correct.\n\n- **Option 3**: This claims that changing other conditions might alter the results. However, the experiments are conducted under unchanged conditions, so changing other factors is unlikely to affect the results.

Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the phenomenon is that refined oil producers' profits are affected by crude oil prices. High crude oil prices mean higher costs, but profits don't decrease; they increase. So, why is that?\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption 0: The cost of crude oil is half of the operating costs. That would mean that half the cost is from crude oil, and the other half is from other factors. So, if the price of crude oil is high, the cost of crude oil is high, but the other costs (like labor, maybe) are low. So, the total cost is high, but the revenue from selling refined oil is higher because the price of refined oil is higher. So, the profit would be higher.\n\nOption 1: The price of refined oil is determined by supply and demand. As crude oil prices go up, the government gives subsidies. So, if the government gives subsidies, the effective price of refined oil goes down. So, even though the cost of crude oil is high, the government is covering part of the cost, so the net cost is lower. So, the price of refined oil is lower, but the price of crude oil is higher. So, the revenue from selling refined oil is lower, but the cost of crude oil is higher. So, the net effect is that profits increase.\n\nOption 2: Refined oil producers cut salaries for high-paid employees. So, if salaries are lower, the cost of labor is lower. But the price of crude oil is still high, so the cost of crude oil is still high. So, the total cost is higher, but the price of refined oil is lower. So, the revenue from selling refined oil is lower, but the cost of crude oil is higher. So, the net effect is that profits decrease.\n\nOption 3: After the price of crude oil rises, import costs and other operating costs also increase. So, the cost of crude oil is high, and other costs are also high. So, the total cost is higher, but the price of refined oil is higher. So, the revenue is higher, and the cost is higher, so profits increase.\n\nSo, the contradictory phenomenon is that profits increase despite higher crude oil prices. So, the options that can explain this are options 1, 3, and 0.\n\nWait, let",

However, in recent years, the price of crude oil has been increasing, leading to higher operating costs for refined oil producers. Despite this, their profits have not decreased; instead, they have increased.\n\nSo, the question is why, despite rising crude oil prices, profits have not decreased. The options are trying to explain this.\n\nStep 3: Analyze each option.\n\nOption 0: The cost of crude oil only accounts for half of the operating costs of refined oil producers.\n\nIf the cost of crude oil is half of the operating costs, then the other half must come from other sources. If the price of crude oil is rising, the cost component would increase, but if the other half remains the same, the total operating costs would increase. However, the profits have not decreased. So, if the cost of crude oil is half, and the price is rising, the cost component increases, but the other half remains the same. So, the total operating costs would increase. But the profits have not decreased. So, this might not explain the phenomenon.\n\nOption 1: The price of refined oil in the country is determined according to market supply and demand. As the price of the international crude oil market rises, the country's government provides corresponding subsidies for refined oil producers.\n\nSo, if the price of refined oil is determined by market supply and demand, and as the price of international crude oil rises, the government provides subsidies. This would mean that the cost of refined oil producers is lower because they get subsidies. So, even though the price of crude oil is rising, the cost of",

So, if we can find an option that directly relates to the idea that online shopping is making physical stores less competitive, that would be the answer.\n\nOption 0: Although online shopping has certain conveniences, it is easy to cause personal information to be used by criminals.\n\nHmm, this seems to be talking about the risks of online shopping, like personal information being stolen.

If online stores are compensating for lost goods, maybe they are more competitive because they can offer better prices or better service.

It might be more about the compensation process rather than the competitiveness of physical stores.\n\nOption 3: Normally, online stores can only survive with the support of their physical stores.\n\nThis seems to suggest that online stores need physical stores to survive. If that's the case, then online stores might not be as competitive because they can't rely on physical stores for their operations. So this directly relates to the professor's point.

The chairman is responding by saying that without confidence, you will lose. So, the chairman is saying that if you don't have confidence, you can't lose.\n\nLet me break this down. The manager is making a statement about confidence not being sufficient for a win. So, confidence is a necessary condition for a win, but not sufficient. That is, to win, you need confidence, but having confidence doesn't guarantee a win.\n\nThe chairman is responding by saying that without confidence, you will lose. So, confidence is a necessary condition for losing as well. If you don't have confidence, you can't lose. So, confidence is necessary for both winning and losing.\n\nWait, but the manager said that confidence doesn't necessarily win. So, if you have confidence, you might win, but it's not guaranteed.

But that doesn't quite fit. Because if you can win without losing, that would mean that winning is possible without losing, but the chairman is saying that without confidence, you will lose. So, without confidence, you can't lose, but you can't win either.\n\nWait, maybe Option 0 is",

The chairman is responding to this, and the options are about the meaning of the chairman's statement.\n\nLet me break down the statements:\n\n1. Manager: \"With confidence, you don't necessarily win.\" This suggests that confidence is not sufficient to ensure a win, but it's not the only way to win either.\n\n2. Chairman: \"But without confidence, you will lose.\" This implies that without confidence, you are more likely to lose, which is the opposite of the manager's statement.\n\nSo, the chairman is saying that without confidence, you will lose. So, the chairman is saying that confidence is necessary for a win, but without confidence, you will lose.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nOption 0: Win without losing, or lose without winning.\n\nThis seems to suggest that either you can win without losing, or you can lose without winning. But that doesn't quite fit the chairman's statement.\n\nOption 1: If you are confident, you will definitely win.\n\nThis seems to align with the manager's statement, but the chairman is saying that without confidence, you will lose. So, this might not be the best fit.\n\nOption 2: Only if you are confident, you may not lose.\n\nThis seems to suggest that confidence is necessary to not lose, but it's not the only way. So, if you are confident, you may not lose, but you might lose if you're not confident. That seems to align with the chairman's statement.\n\nOption 3: Unless you are confident, it is impossible to lose.\n\nThis suggests that losing is only possible if you are not confident. So, if you are confident, you might not lose, but if you are not confident, you will lose. That seems to align with the chairman's statement.\n\nWait, let me think again.\n\nThe manager said that with confidence, you don't necessarily win. So, confidence doesn't guarantee a win, but it's not the only way to win either.",

The company\u2019s expenditure on office supplies decreased by 30% compared to the previous year. Without the plan, the company used to consume 100,000 yuan annually. So, the plan must have saved 70,000 yuan (since 100,000 - 70,000 = 30,000, which is a 30% decrease).\n\nNow, the question is: Which of the options, if true, would most likely question the general manager\u2019s inference? That is, which option would challenge the assumption that the plan saved a lot of money, or perhaps question the validity of the inference?\n\nLet me analyze each option:\n\nOption 0: Another company that is similar in size and other basic conditions to the company has not implemented a similar thrift plan and has consumed an average of 100,000 yuan in office supplies in the past 5 years.\n\nThis option suggests that other companies with similar conditions have not implemented the plan and have spent the same amount. If this is true, it could imply that the company's spending is not necessarily lower than others, but it doesn't directly address whether the plan saved money. It might suggest that the company's spending is similar to others, but it doesn't directly challenge the inference about the plan's effectiveness.\n\nOption 1: In the past 5 years, the company has vigorously promoted paperless office and made great achievements.\n\nThis option suggests that the company has improved efficiency and achieved significant results. It doesn't directly relate to the spending on office supplies or the effectiveness of the frugality plan. Therefore, it might not directly question the general manager's inference about the savings.\n\nOption 2: \"Fruit plan for office supplies\" is an important means to control expenditures, but said that the plan \"saved a lot of money within one year\" for the company, there is no rigorous data analysis.\n\nThis option suggests that the company has adopted a \"fruit plan\" for office supplies, which is a method to control expenditures, and that this plan has saved a lot of money in one year.

The reporter concluded that Younan was the core player of the Xihai team last season. To best question this conclusion, which option should be true?\n\nThe reporter's conclusion is that Younan was the core player, meaning he was essential for the team's success. The reporter's data shows that when Younan played, the team's winning rate was high, and when he didn't play, the winning rate dropped. So, the presence of Younan was crucial for the team's performance.\n\nTo question this conclusion, we need an option that provides evidence against the idea that Younan was the core player. That is, an option that shows that without Younan, the team's performance would have been worse, or that Younan's absence was not the only reason for the drop in winning rate.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption 0: All games where Yonan played and Xihai lost were key games against strong teams. This suggests that Yonan's absence in those games didn't lead to a significant drop in performance, which would contradict the reporter's conclusion. If Yonan was essential, then when he played, the team's performance would have been better, and when he didn't, it would have been worse. So, if Yonan's absence in those games didn't lead to a significant drop, it would question the reporter's conclusion.\n\nOption 1: The Xihai team captain said something about losing a lot without Yonan but finding a solution. This seems like a positive statement about Yonan's importance. If the captain said that without Yonan, the team would lose a lot but could find a solution, it would reinforce the reporter's conclusion that Yonan was crucial. This would not best question the conclusion.\n\nOption 2: The Xihai team's winning rate has dropped by 20% since the start. This suggests that Yonan's absence caused a significant drop in performance. If the team's winning rate has dropped by 20%, it would contradict the idea that Yonan was the only factor. This would best question the reporter's conclusion.\n\nOption 3: The games where Yonan missed and Xihai lost were all games the Xihai team has already qualified for. This suggests that Yonan's absence in those games didn't affect the team's performance, which would contradict the reporter's conclusion. If Yon",

They hypothesized that autism is linked to the amount of neural junction protein synthesis. If inhibiting the protein synthesis of neuronectin can relieve the symptoms of autism, this directly supports the view that autism has an important relationship with the amount of neural junction protein synthesis.

This suggests that autism is less common in the experimental group, which might imply that the association between protein synthesis and autism is weaker. However, this doesn't directly link the amount of protein synthesis to autism, so it might not support the main view.\n\nOption 1: The proportion of male autism rats is five times that of female ones. This indicates that males are more affected with autism, which could suggest a biological difference, but it doesn't directly address the link between protein synthesis and autism.\n\nOption 2: Inhibiting protein synthesis of neuronectin relieves autism symptoms. This directly supports the main idea because it shows that reducing the synthesis of neuronectin proteins can improve the quality of life for the mice, which might indicate that the underlying issue (autism) is related to excessive protein synthesis.\n\nOption 3: If the key genes controlling protein synthesis are removed, neuronal connections increase. This suggests that without the necessary genes, the brain can't connect properly, leading to issues like autism. This supports the idea that the key genes are involved in the synthesis of proteins, which is linked to autism.\n\nNow, comparing options 2 and 3. Both are directly supporting the main idea.
